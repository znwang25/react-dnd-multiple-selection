# react-dnd-multiple-selection
This repo implements multiple selection drag and drop using the [react-dnd](https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/about) library and react hooks.

It is inspired and based on [@melvynhills](https://github.com/melvynhills)'s solution posted in this [issue](https://github.com/react-dnd/react-dnd/issues/14). But his implementation was using the legacy APIs, so I rewrote the component using new APIs as of 2020.
